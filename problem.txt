Design a multiplex management system that allows admins to manage multiplex, screens, seats, and movies played across those screens and customers to book the movie ticket.

This multiplex management system is operational in only 1 city (Mumbai) which will have multiple multiplex buildings across various locations. (Exa: Central Mall, Inorbit Mall, etcâ€¦)

Each multiplex will have a few screens and each screen will have various categories of seats (silver, gold, platinum, etc...) based on the screen setup
Each screen will have some movie being played on it and this schedule can be configured along with the price of a seat for each category. Example:
    Multiplex: Central Mall
    Screen: 1
    Movie: Movie Title
    Time: 2 PM to 5 PM
    Prices:
        Silver: 150
        Gold: 200
        Platinum: 250

Provide filtering capability to check the availability of the seats for a given movie title or specific multiplex branch. Keep the implementation extensible so that new filters can be easily added with minimal effort on filtering logic. Only movie and multiplex filters need to be implemented. Example:
    Movie = Movie Title
    Multiplex = Central Mall

Provide the sorting capability to sort the results based on the cheapest show first strategy so that the cheapest show can be shown on the top. Keep the implementation extensible so that new sorters can be easily added with minimal effort on sorting logic. Only the cheapest show first sorting strategy needs to be implemented.

After checking the availability of seats the customer can perform the booking
